ulogcat is the equivalent of Android 'logcat' for ulog messages, with a few
additional features:

* Support for the following types of log buffers:
  - ulog
  - kernel ring

The contents of those buffers can be merged or viewed separately
Options -k (kernel ring) and -u (ulog) specify buffers from which messages
should be read, processed and merged.

IMPORTANT NOTE: in order to support kernel ring messages, ulogcat relies
on daemon kmsgd (in project ulog.git).
On a Linux PC, the native syslog daemon may be interfering with daemon kmsgd and
prevent option -k from working properly.

* Output format can be one the following (optionally colored):
  short, aligned, process, long, csv
