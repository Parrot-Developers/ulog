libulog
=======
This is a minimalistic logging library derived from Android logger.

If your kernel does not have the ulogger driver (drivers/staging/ulogger),
you'll need to apply the patch provided in kernel/ulogger.patch. It should apply
cleanly or with trivial changes on a recent kernel.

Read include/ulog.h for more information about this library.
